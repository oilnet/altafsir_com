This repository holds a corpus of [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran) exegetical works (called [sg. tafseer, pl. tafaseer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafsir)) scraped from [altafsir.com](http://www.altafsir.com/tafasir.asp?tmadhno=0&ttafsirno=0&tsorano=1&tayahno=1&tdisplay=no&languageid=1), a website ran by the Kingdom of Jordan. Please not that the data themselves are in the public domain. The corpus holds a total of 68 books, each of which covers a subset of Quranic verses (called [sg. aaya, pl. aayaat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayah)). At the bottom of the folder structure inside `yaml`, you will find one [YAML](http://yaml.org) file per tafseer per aaya, even in those cases where a tafseer gives no commentary on that specific aaya (in which case the metadata will still be present, but the 'text' field will not).

Apart from the YAML files, which are the primary representation of the collected data, a number of other file types into which the YAML files have been processed, are provided as well. Please see the respective subfolders.
